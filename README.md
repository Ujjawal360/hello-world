# Research analysis on global alcohol consumption against the GDP of the nations

I did a research analysis to know about the situation of alcoholism prevailing in Nepal and in the whole world. Using data science, I wanted to know how much peopleâ€™s earnings are spent on alcohol. One of my findings is that Nepal being an underdeveloped country, falls in the 87th percentile of alcohol consumption and spends a whooping US$404 million on alcohol annually. My findings have been here on Medium.
